title: "Blabber Blast"
tldr: "This project uses Unity, the Oculus Interaction and Voice SDKs, the OpenAI Completions API, and custom classes and scripts to create a 'shooting gallery' game that can be controlled by the player's speech. The Completions API takes an arbitrary string and returns a target configuration in json form that is then parsed by the game to produce a novel configuration of targets. For a demo of the game, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)."
