title: "PA Exam App"
tldr: "This project uses the Typescript and React to build an iPad app for professors to more easily grade verbal exams. We built it for Physician Assistant programs, but it could be used in any setting where a professor needs to grade a verbal exam from a student. For a demo of the app, see [this video](#demo-vid)."
