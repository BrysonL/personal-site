tldr: "This project uses Hugo to generate a static site with all the content I want. The site is hosted on Github Pages and I use a Github Actions workflow to automatically update and publish the site with each commit. This website is the result!"

This website is a static site generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This means I write some code in a combination of markdown, HTML/CSS, and Javascript and Hugo will compile it to a collection of files that won't change. This is in contrast to many website and apps you use that are dynamic based on content you input, your user account information, etc. I chose to use Hugo at the suggestion of ChatGPT, and it has been very convenient to use. It can also be hosted (for free) on Github pages (though [the code](https://github.com/BrysonL/personal-site) has to remain public for free hosting).

I got started using the [Hugo sustain](https://github.com/suyundukov/hugo-sustain) theme, but at this point I've modified much of the base template code. There are many powerful features that I've taken advantage of like shortcodes (markdown that will compile into HTML so I only have to write it once) and templates (that let me define the layout of page types and then feed in markdown files to populate it).

Overall I highly recommend the framework. If you start using it and have questions or want to know how I've done something on the site, just ask.
